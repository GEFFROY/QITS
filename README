I. What is QITS ?
-----------------------------------------------------
QITS is acronym of Quercus Implementation Testing System.
It's a little PHP script for testing existence of PHP classes, methods, functions and constants.
It can be used to create a "score" of implementation during Quercus development.

Quercus is Caucho Technology's fast, open-source, 100% Java implementation of the PHP language.


II. Installation
-----------------------------------------------------
Just create a new application on your Java Application Server and put content of QITS.
Don't forget to copy libraries of Quercus.


III. Execution
-----------------------------------------------------
Just go on http://url:port/QITS/
The index file will load all informations via JS/Ajax scripts.


IV. Update indexes
-----------------------------------------------------
Indexes are in datas/ folder.
*.list are complete lists, extracted from php.net
*.ignore are lists of ignored items in the implementation tests (ex: Win32 functions)

To update indexes, just put new items in the right file :
constants.* : lists of PHP Constants
functions.* : lists of PHP Functions
classes.* : lists of PHP Classes
methods.* : lists of PHP Methods
